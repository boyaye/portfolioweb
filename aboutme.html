                 <p>Since 1960, we’ve built a reputation for excellence. We value relationships established on a promise and cultivated with trust. Our most valuable resources are our people who carry forth our traditions, values, and long-standing reputation for performance. Though we span seven offices and projects in more than 30 states, we strive to operate as “one company.” This means our teams work together across regions and markets to deliver a high quality, consistent result to our clients no matter where we serve them. We have consistently ranked at the top of ENR's Top 400 Contractor's list, and for the last 15 years listed in the nation's largest data center builders</p>

                    <p>Holder’s reputation for delivering the highest level of service and collaborating with clients and partners parallels our founding principle: "Do the kind of job that makes our clients want us to do their next project.” The result, more than 90% of our work is from repeat clients. The strength of our relationships, our dedicated associates, and operating as "one company" has allowed us to build on a national level and support our clients wherever they have a need.</p>
