# portfoliowebsite
this is the website about me
I made the header to hold both the navigation bar and the header
# I add the sigup page and I add a link that will take you to a sign up page when you click
I add a click to create profile and sign in , with your username and password
to be about sign in as a member and have all the update from buddy global group

# On the sign up page , I apply the use of the form in other to input data
also ont the login page, I create a space for username and passwork when you click on the login page

I made sure all the link on the pages works, by creating a different html and css on each of the page.

I create html and css for the Login page, About, signup,home page, and the career like takes you to my previous job, the first home work.

on the footers, I add the image link to each of the app, like the google and Ios, and also on the social media add.
